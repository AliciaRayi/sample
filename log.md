# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2019 Thursday


**Today's Progress**: Created a classroom setting through Google Classrom for my study group. (uploaded syllabus, opened Slack channel, organized Zoom meeting) 

**Thoughts:** Since I've decided this self-taught route at least for 3 months I want to make this time as productive as possible.

### Day 2: August 23, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to clone repo, created a personal page, had technical interview with a/A

**Thoughts:**: Started pair programming with friends and even in the technical interview. While coding, thinking out loud and explaining your strategy to the interviewer was tough but all of this is just a FUN.

### Day 3: August 24, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 10 modules in freeCodeCamp and done pair programming through repl.it about CSS selectors drills in Thinkful.

### Day 6: August 27, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through module 2.13 in freeCodeCamp and Agela Yu module 14.

**Thoughts:** I've been through a lot of research about bootcamp programs for a month now. Expecting to become more consistent than self-taught, I've applied several bootcamps, but not many bootcamps provide a solid portfolio building course. So I came down to freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Codecademy, Microverse, Launch School and Nucamp. I want to make a good enough portfolio during this 100 days of the challenge and start applying jobs from small company. And while applying for jobs I'll start going for in-person classes and meetups for interview perparation. Plus, will get a HTML, CSS and Javascript certificate from Microsoft. Since my main goal for three months onward is building a portfolio I'll focus on freeCodeCamp, Udemy and Codecademy. And then will consider those cohort bootcamps.

**Tomorrow's task**
1. Learning lab from Github
2. a/A Ruby Intro review

### Day 9: August 30, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished basic CSS in freeCodeCamp and gone through Agela Yu module 34.

**Thoughts:** Rejected a/A admission eventually, but since I'm gonna prepare GDPR certificates at the same time, it's better to take part-time bootcamp, so I'm good. And hope I can jump into Javascript soon. Think I'm spending too much on HTML and CSS. At least in fCC think I can start Javascript part even now.
I set a goal to do 10 modules per day for fCC, Udemy both.
Hmm.. I want to take Colt class though,, and Codecademy.. 
I'm afraid of doing fCC projects all by myself, I think some of them don't have enough explanations for answers.

**Tomorrow's task** (minimum)
1. fCC module 3.10
2. Udemy module 50
3. Github learning lab
4. Windows 10 upgrade (backup)

### Day 10: August 31, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've started Applied Visual Design and Basic JavaScript in freeCodeCamp and gone through Agela Yu module 44. + introduction of Colt's bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** 15 modules fCC + 10 modules Udemy. Didn't expect it to be too much but i think this is almost maximum I can do per day at least for now. I want to add Colt's and Leet Code or Hacker Rank practice problems though not sure at this point.
I think right now is still laying foundations of each skill the most important part here is not to get bored and give up.
So before entering React, Node.js I'll take several different courses to keep me involved.

**Tomorrow's task** (minimum)
1. Github summary
2. Udemy module 50 (Angela) + Colt
3. fCC CSS + JavaScript

### Day 11: September 1, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Spent a whole day to summarize use cases of Git & Github. And then hurried to finish up daily tasks but only completed fCC. I'll catch up Angela's Udemy today.

**Thoughts:** Today was challenging and rewarding at the same time. Once challenged you became so depressed that all the progress you made got blurred but they remain within you. The more you lose confidence the harder you should try. Then tomorrow will be better than today. 

**Tomorrow's task** (minimum)
1. Udemy module 50 (Angela) + Colt module 15

### Day 20: September 11, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Z-index and Media query

**Thoughts:** I got stuck with the concept of the position property - absolute, relative, fixed, static. I get how each of them works but when it comes to decide which position property to choose to make a certain image go on top of another.. I'm not sure what to choose between relative and absolute. Hmm I thought the more I take lessons I would get better understanding but so far no..
