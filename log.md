# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2019 Thursday


**Today's Progress**: Created a classroom setting through Google Classrom for my study group. (uploaded syllabus, opened Slack channel, organized Zoom meeting) 

**Thoughts:** Since I've decided this self-taught route at least for 3 months I want to make this time as productive as possible.

### Day 2: August 23, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to clone repo, created a personal page, had technical interview with a/A

**Thoughts:**: Started pair programming with friends and even in the technical interview. While coding, thinking out loud and explaining your strategy to the interviewer was tough but all of this is just a FUN.

### Day 3: August 24, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 10 modules in freeCodeCamp and done pair programming through repl.it about CSS selectors drills in Thinkful.

**Thoughts:** Although at the early stage, pair programming helps to reinforce my knowledge by communicating with partners.

### Day 6: August 27, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through module 2.13 in freeCodeCamp and Agela Yu module 14.

**Thoughts:** I've been through a lot of research about bootcamp programs for a month now. Expecting to become more consistent than self-taught, I've applied several bootcamps, but not many bootcamps provide a solid portfolio building course. So I came down to freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Codecademy, Microverse, Launch School and Nucamp. I want to make a good enough portfolio during this 100 days of the challenge and start applying jobs from small company. And while applying for jobs I'll start going for in-person classes and meetups for interview perparation. Plus, will get a HTML, CSS and Javascript certificate from Microsoft. Since my main goal for three months onward is building a portfolio I'll focus on freeCodeCamp, Udemy and Codecademy. And then will consider those cohort bootcamps.

**Tomorrow's task**
1. Learning lab from Github
2. a/A Ruby Intro review
